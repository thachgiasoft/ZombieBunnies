// This file contains all the thoughts about the creation of this game

// Storing 50 files in the main group did not work - create folder - done
// Creating 50 similar files is a lot of work - lootk at using array's to hold the text and variables to hold the goto_Number
// Formatting the text is not straight forward, need to look at creating a standard screen that keeps the same format no matter what text is passed.
// A single folder of 50 files is also not good - look at sub-folders or more folders e.g. 1-10, then 11-20 etc - done
// For this sort of game create a MAP that links all the files together then tick off as each one is created.
// Look at adding the odd picture every so often, just text is not very exciting for the modern world. - done
